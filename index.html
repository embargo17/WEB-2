<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Fiifi! A passionate Junior Web Developer with three years of experience turning ideas into interactive and responsive web solutions. My journey in web development began during my first degree at Ghana Communication Technology University, where I discovered my love for coding and building user-friendly digital experiences.

    I started with HTML, and over time, I’ve expanded my skillset to include CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React. Along the way, I’ve also gained knowledge in web hosting, domain name registration, and SEO strategies, ensuring the websites I create are not only functional but also optimized for visibility and performance.</p>

    Responsive Design: Ensuring websites look great on any device, from desktops to smartphones.
    SEO Optimization: Enhancing website visibility through effective on-page SEO strategies.
    Web Hosting and Deployment: Managing website hosting, domain registration, and live deployment for seamless online experiences.
    I’m always learning and adapting to new technologies, with a keen interest in exploring TypeScript, Next.js, and back-end development to expand my capabilities further.</p>
